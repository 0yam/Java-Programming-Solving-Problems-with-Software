Java Programming Solving Problems with Software
===============================================   
This course is offered at [Coursera]( https://www.coursera.org, "coursera link") and is part of multiple programs:

* [Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming)
* [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)

I decided to take this course for learning to code in Java and improve my programming and problem-solving skills, [Link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming).



# IMPORTANT NOTE:

Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this code. You can get the IDE from the University website [here](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2).
